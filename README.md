# rosary-decade
The Rosary is a Roman Catholic devotional prayer in honor of the Bessed Virgin Mary. It is comprised of smaller prayers, the bulk of which are called decades or mysteries. In a single decade of the Rosary you pray The Lord's Prayer (Our Father) once, The Hail Mary ten times, followed by one Glory Be. This front end project takes the burden off of traversing through Hail Mary beads with its numeric counter and functional increment, decrement, and reset buttons. Others who wish to pray the Rosary, but don't have a physical one, can use this as a substitute.
